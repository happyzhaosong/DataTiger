Best Method for calculate click count for item url:
1.When user click one item url, then first update click_count in data_click_log table.
2.Then update click_count in data_xiu_hao_chi data table.
3.Order item by click_count in data_xiu_hao_chi data table.
4.If system admin update data in data_xiu_hao_chi data table, then click_count in that table all will become 0.
5.Go back to step 1.
